Project Nexus: Your Personal Desktop Voice Assistant

Nexus is a voice-activated desktop assistant designed to streamline your daily tasks and enhance your productivity. Built with Python, this project brings the convenience of a personal AI assistant directly to your computer.

✨ Features
With simple voice commands, Nexus can perform a variety of actions to help you stay organized and efficient.

🌐 Open Websites and Desktop Apps: Launch your favorite websites and applications instantly. Just tell Nexus what you want to open, and it'll handle the rest.

✅ Make To-Do Lists: Keep track of your tasks and never forget a deadline. Simply dictate your to-do list, and Nexus will save it for you.

📰 Get Current News Headlines: Stay informed with the latest news. Nexus can fetch and read the top news headlines.

🔊 Control System Volume: Adjust your computer's volume with a simple command. Increase or decrease the volume to your desired level without lifting a finger.

Note: I have created my own wake word by using the Picovoice Console, a free online tool that allows you to train and download a new wake word model file (.ppn).
